InterSystems Products Support
-----------------------------

ObjectScript Visual Editor is supported by **InterSystems' products of version 2016.1 and higher**. 

Installation
------------

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/intersystems-community/objectscript-visual-editor/releases) and import
XML file into IRIS/Caché/etc by one of the next ways:

- Just drag'n'drop the XML file on the Studio window;
- **OR** Go to the Management Portal -> System Explorer -> Classes -> Import and select the XML file;
- **OR** Execute `do $system.OBJ.Load("C:\path\to\file\FileToImport.xml","ck")` in terminal.

Then check the installation output, it should say "Installation is complete!".

After this, open the next web-application: `http://[host]/VisualEditor/`
(slash at the end is required).

Development
-----------

#### Pre-requirements

To participate in development of this application, you need Git, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and
**InterSystems' Products of version 2016.2+** to be installed (due to UDL import support).

The development process of this application **happens completely outside embedded IDEs** in a form of files. It includes
structured file tree under `source` directory, where each file can be edited in your favorite text
editor.

At first, clone the repository. It contains submodules, so use the `--recursive` flag when cloning:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/intersystems-community/objectscript-visual-editor
cd objectscript-visual-editor
```

Then you have to install all the project dependencies by running this command from the project's
root:

```bash
npm install
```

And now you are ready to build the project from the sources!

#### Building and testing

This time and each next run this:

```bash
npm run gulp
```

Take your ready to import sources in `build/cache` folder.

#### One-command build and XML export

**To simplify** development on Windows (scripts for other platforms are welcome),
make the copy of `import.bat` file and edit the path to your IRIS/Caché/etc instance there.
Then you can just use one command `import` to deploy the project from source to IRIS/Caché.

After setting `import.bat` up, **just by one command** `import` you get the next:

1. Project is built by Gulp;
2. VisualEditor package is imported into IRIS/Caché;
3. The XML file containing ready-to-deploy package is exported to `build` directory.
